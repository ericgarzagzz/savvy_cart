# Database Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Refactor the monolithic `DatabaseHelper` class (1200+ lines) into a cleaner, maintainable repository pattern while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## Current Issues
- **Single Responsibility Violation**: One class handles all database operations for all entities
- **Code Duplication**: Repetitive error handling and query patterns
- **Poor Testability**: Singleton pattern makes unit testing difficult
- **Business Logic Mixing**: Analytics and mock data generation mixed with data access
- **Maintenance Difficulty**: Adding new entities requires modifying the massive class

## Proposed Architecture

### New Structure
```
lib/data/
├── database/
│   ├── database_manager.dart          # Connection management
│   ├── migration_manager.dart         # Schema creation/migrations
│   └── base_repository.dart           # Common patterns/error handling
├── repositories/
│   ├── shop_list_repository.dart      # Shop list CRUD operations
│   ├── shop_list_item_repository.dart # Shop list item operations
│   ├── chat_message_repository.dart   # Chat message operations
│   ├── suggestion_repository.dart     # Suggestion operations
│   └── analytics_repository.dart      # Analytics queries
├── services/
│   ├── mock_data_service.dart         # Mock data generation
│   └── insights_service.dart          # Business logic calculations
└── data_manager.dart                  # Main facade/coordinator
```

### Migration Strategy - Zero Breaking Changes

#### Phase 1: Create New Architecture (Week 1)
1. Create new repository classes
2. Create `DataManager` facade
3. Keep `DatabaseHelper` as delegate to new system
4. All existing code continues to work unchanged

#### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Week 2-3)
1. Migrate providers to use new API (optional)
2. Migrate services to use new API (optional)
3. Add enhanced features (batch operations, transactions)

#### Phase 3: Cleanup (Week 4)
1. Mark old methods as deprecated
2. Complete migration of remaining code
3. Remove old `DatabaseHelper` class

## Code Examples

### Current Usage (continues to work)
```dart
// All existing code works unchanged
final shopLists = await DatabaseHelper.instance.getShopLists();
await DatabaseHelper.instance.addShopListItem(item);
```

### New API Options
```dart
// Option 1: Still works (zero changes)
final shopLists = await DatabaseHelper.instance.getShopLists();

// Option 2: New clean API (optional migration)
final dataManager = DataManager.instance;
final shopLists = await dataManager.shopLists.getAll();
final items = await dataManager.shopListItems.getByShopListId(shopListId);

// Option 3: Enhanced features
await dataManager.shopListItems.addBatch(items);
await dataManager.transaction((tx) async {
  await tx.shopLists.add(shopList);
  await tx.shopListItems.addBatch(items);
});
```

### Repository Pattern Example
```dart
class ShopListRepository extends BaseRepository {
  Future<List<ShopList>> getAll() async {
    return handleDatabaseOperation(() async {
      Database db = await database;
      var result = await db.query("shop_lists", orderBy: "created_at DESC");
      return result.map((x) => ShopList.fromMap(x)).toList();
    });
  }

  Future<List<ShopList>> getPaginated({int limit = 3, int offset = 0}) async {
    return handleDatabaseOperation(() async {
      Database db = await database;
      var result = await db.query(
        "shop_lists",
        orderBy: "created_at DESC",
        limit: limit,
        offset: offset,
      );
      return result.map((x) => ShopList.fromMap(x)).toList();
    });
  }

  Future<int> add(ShopList shopList) async {
    return handleDatabaseOperation(() async {
      Database db = await database;
      final now = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
      final shopListMap = shopList.toMap();
      shopListMap['created_at'] = shopList.createdAt?.millisecondsSinceEpoch ?? now;
      shopListMap['updated_at'] = shopList.updatedAt?.millisecondsSinceEpoch ?? now;
      return await db.insert("shop_lists", shopListMap);
    });
  }
}
```
